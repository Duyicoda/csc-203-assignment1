    <p>
Once upon a time, i got chanced to meet a striving teenager who thinks the sky as just a starting point and not his limit.
looking up to the stars in the sky with a wandering heart and a vision not so clear he asked himself... 

    </p>

    <p>
        what is the purpose of life??
        why earth??, a common question a depressed teenager would ask but No,
        bobo was not depressed he just wanted to find his own meaning about life.

    </p>
    <p> just there and then he shouted YES!! and jumped off his mat,

    he described life as an ocean where you have to swim to get your starfish( starfish impliying your purpose in life )
    and the reason life is so tough is because you have to swim to the bottom of the sea ( your journey in life ) your journey in life to find your purpose and he said to himself smiling 
    " I NEED TO GO SWIMMING"
    </p>
