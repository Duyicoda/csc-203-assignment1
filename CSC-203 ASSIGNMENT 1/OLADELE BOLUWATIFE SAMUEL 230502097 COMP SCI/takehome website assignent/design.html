            received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects | learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.
             I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
             I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! ! enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
            life. Since completing the course, l've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.*
