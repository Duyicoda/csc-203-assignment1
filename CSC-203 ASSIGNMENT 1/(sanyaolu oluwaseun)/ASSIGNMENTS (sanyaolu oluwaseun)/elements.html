            <h2>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the future. From healthcare to entertainment, AI has the potential to transform nearly every aspect of our lives.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>As we enter the age of AI, it's crucial to understand its potential. For example, <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> can assist in diagnosing diseases, recommending personalized learning experiences, and even driving autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Computing: A New Frontier</h2>
            <p>Another revolutionary technology on the horizon is <abbr title="Quantum Computing">QC</abbr>. Unlike traditional computers, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously.</p>
            <p>This could lead to breakthroughs in fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and material science.</p>

            <p>As noted by Dr. Alice Lee in her research paper, "Quantum computing is not just an incremental improvement over classical computing, it's a paradigm shift" (<cite>Lee, A. (2023). <i>Quantum Computing: The Next Revolution</i>. Tech Journal, 56(3), 123-130.</cite>).</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>With these advancements come serious ethical questions. How will automation impact jobs? What are the privacy implications of AI? These are questions that we must address as technology continues to evolve.</p>

            <p>As tech philosopher <strong>Dr. Emily Carter</strong> states, <q>"The speed at which technology is advancing means that we need to be more thoughtful about its integration into society."</q></p>

            <p>We are only beginning to scratch the surface of these questions, and it will take global collaboration to ensure that technology serves humanity positively.</p>
